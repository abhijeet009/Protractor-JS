Hello,
Welcome to a huddle board Automation framework. I have used POM for framework.

Steps
1) To start server use command " webdriver-manager start"
2) To install all dependency use command "npm install"
3) For test case all Page objects are added in page folder and test steps are under test folder
4) To run Test case use command " protractor .\conf\conf.js --suite signup" (change signup,login as per the test case) you want to run.

If you feel any version related error use npm Update command 

Thanks and happy testing
